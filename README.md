# :rocket: Deploy on Heroku

<p>Don't have time to read all the repository but you want to take a look on the end of the project, you'are on the good branch ! </p>

<p>Download the repository and go into the root of the folder you donwloaded.</p>

<p>:warning: You still need to have installed Heroku CLI on your computer.</p>


<p>In your terminal in the root of folder type : </p>

<code>npm install </code><br>

<code> heroku create </code>
<p><i> In this case, the name of your application is randomly generated and return an url such as https://hidden-crag-28698.herokuapp.com/ </i> </p>

<p><b>OR</b></p>

<code> heroku create example </code>
<p><i> In this case <i>"example"</i> is the name you want to provide to your application. This will return an url such as https://example.herokuapp.com/</i> </p>


<p>That should create an application on Heroku and return to you the URL where you can find your application, you also get an url for the repository of your new application.</p> 

<p>Let's follow with :  </p>

<code> git commit -am 'socket.io project done.' </code>

<br>

<code>git push heroku master</code>

<p> At the end of this command you should see something like this : </p>
